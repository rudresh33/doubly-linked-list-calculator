## Introduction
The implementation of a calculator using a doubly linked list represents a significant advancement in arithmetic computation. This project leverages the inherent flexibility and efficiency of the doubly linked list to manage and evaluate arithmetic expressions effectively.

---

## Approach
- **Node class**: Stores individual elements of the arithmetic expression with pointers to previous and next nodes.  
- **DoublyLinkedList class**: Container for nodes, enabling insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
- **evaluate_expression function**: Parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions using linked list traversal and manipulation.

## Features
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division (with division-by-zero handling)  
- Percentage calculation  
- Square root  
- History of previous calculations  

---

## Error Handling
- Division by zero is caught and reported gracefully (`Error: Division by zero`).  
- Prevents crashes or undefined results.
